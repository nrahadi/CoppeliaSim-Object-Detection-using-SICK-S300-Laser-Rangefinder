# CoppeliaSim-Object-Detection-using-SICK-S300-Laser-Rangefinder
This simulation program is used to detect the object(s) in front of the SICK S300 Laser Rangefinder module, and transfer the recorded data to the MATLAB environment.

Coppelia Robotics Simulator (or commonly known as V-REP) is used in this simulation, due to its direct compatibility with MATLAB as an independent data processing environment. In instance, CoppeliaSim will be used to design the simulation environment, featuring the SICK S-300 laser rangefinder and some primitive shaped objects. The sensor measurement will be transferred to the MATLAB Workspace to be able to process the data further.
